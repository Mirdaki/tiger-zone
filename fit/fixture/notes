1. In order to compile use case fixture code I must use javac -classpath. *.java while in proper directory or class will fail to find other class even if they are in the same directory

2. Fitnesse is unable to invoke constructor for use case classes.  It is an issue with !path, if I overstate path it gives a no class def error and if I understate the path it gives error unable to invoke constructor.  Issue is likely related to issue 1.

3. I am currently unaware of how to push to git repo

4. Rather than rewriting all of the tests I created to fit new names such as the jump from SquareTile to TigerTile.  I am having difficulty manuvering between different pushes to the repo.
