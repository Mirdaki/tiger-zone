# JUnit Tests

The following tests are JUnit tests designed to test the methods of each entity in our system. All JUnit tests were made in Eclipse and can be run in Eclipse, similar to any other JUnit test files. The test code can be built and compiled in the same way as the client. The tests can then be run by pressing CTRL+F11 or clicking Run in the top navigation bar. You can run all tests at once by highlighting the tests package in the package explorer and then running, or you can run one test at a time by highlighting the desired JUnit test and running it.
