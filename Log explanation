STARTING TILE IS TLTJ- AT 0 0 0 // happens all 6 times. The tile stack is identical in all cases as well.

Round 1 against TEAMR
Game 1 they play first
FORFEIT b/c: The 2nd time we place in this game, we try to place a tile in correct orientation where Team R had already placed a tile in their very first move. Maybe our board didn’t update for their move? Tiger orientation was already wrong. 
Game 2 we play first
We didn’t place a tiger even though we went first because of the alternate placing. 
We didn’t place a tiger when we completed a lake with our 2nd placement (region didn’t update to complete status or check was incorrect).
FORFEIT b/c: In move #15 (our 8th), we put tiger in new jungle region but called zone 2 instead of 1 (the minimum). INVALID.

Round 2 against TEAMG
Game 1 they play first
FORFEIT b/c: In move #12 (our 5th), we put tiger in new lake but called zone 2 instead of 1 (the minimum). INVALID
Probably shouldn’t have tried placing tiger there since that tile came with a crocodile.
